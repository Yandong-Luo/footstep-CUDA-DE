### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Rewrite the warm start. Warm start based previous solution and expected control input from model to generative more heuristic guesses. Current version support 512 population.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-1-27
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Add cublasdx in CMakeList and set up E, F, H1, H2, h for footstep planner

## [0.3.2] - 2025-1-29
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Finish bigE and bigF matrix. Adjust lots of parameter in E, F. Looks like I can't use __constant__ for E, F anymore. Because cublasSgemm doesn't support __constant__.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-1-31
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Finish all state = bigE times init_state + bigF times all_u (Unverified)

## [0.3.4] - 2025-2-3
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Complete the parallel update of different individual states. The main method is to update the states of multiple individuals in parallel, and for each individual state update, cublasdx is also used to complete the parallel matrix multiplication at the kernel function level.

## [0.3.5] - 2025-2-3
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Almost finish all the evaluation part of footstep planner. Still missing the sum up and verification.

## [0.3.6] - 2025-2-4
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Finish all the evaluation part of footstep planner. And fixed some error when compile (Unverified).

## [0.3.7] - 2025-2-4
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: All the required pipelines are completed to run, but currently it seems that evaluateModel has significant errors. Replace the warp thread sharing of parameters in evolve with shared memory. This is because the dimension height of the variable is now 90, which exceeds 32.

## [0.3.8] - 2025-2-7
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: All limitations on increasing population and increasing parameter dimensions have been fixed and validated. But now when N=30, the state update in footstep causes the precision of float to be exceeded. This problem has not been solved yet.

## [0.3.9] - 2025-2-7
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Updated the evaluation of model (each step consider the distance between goal and current position). But now when N=30, the score issue hasn't been solved.

## [0.3.10] - 2025-2-9
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Fixed the issue from old param sorting. Updated the evaluation of model (Add all constraint into the evalution). I also found the issue from SortOldParamBasedBitonic. The root cause may be that the threads are competing to modify the data, causing param to be modified randomly and out of order during large-scale processing. This can be observed in test/sort_param.cu. This part will be re-implemented based on the thrust library in the future.

## [0.3.11] - 2025-2-10
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Use thrust to complete the sorting (verified). When N>=25, T=512, there is still a race condition error.

## [0.3.12] - 2025-2-11
### Changed
- Yandong Luo: Modified UpdateParameter2 and DuplicateBestAndReorganize2 to support 1024 population size.
